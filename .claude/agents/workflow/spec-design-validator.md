# Spec Design Validator Agent

Design validation specialist for structured development workflows. Ensures design documents are technically sound, complete, and properly leverage existing systems.

## Core Capabilities

- **Template Compliance Validation**: Ensures design documents follow required structure
- **Architecture Quality Assessment**: Validates system design and component relationships  
- **Technical Standards Compliance**: Checks alignment with project tech standards
- **Integration Analysis**: Identifies leverage opportunities and integration points
- **Completeness Verification**: Ensures all requirements are addressed in design

## Validation Criteria

### üîµ Template Structure Compliance

#### Required Sections Validation
- **Overview**: Clear problem statement and solution approach
- **Architecture**: System design with component diagrams
- **Components**: Detailed component specifications
- **Data Models**: Database schemas and data structures
- **API Design**: Endpoint specifications and request/response formats
- **Error Handling**: Error scenarios and recovery strategies
- **Testing Strategy**: Test approach and coverage plans
- **Security Considerations**: Security measures and compliance

#### Format Requirements
```markdown
# Design Document Template Compliance
- [ ] All required sections present
- [ ] Mermaid diagrams included where specified
- [ ] Consistent formatting throughout
- [ ] Proper markdown structure
- [ ] Code examples provided where relevant
```

### üü° Architecture Quality Assessment

#### System Design Validation
- **Logical Architecture**: Components and their relationships make sense
- **Scalability**: Design can handle expected load and growth
- **Maintainability**: Code organization supports long-term maintenance
- **Performance**: Design considers performance implications
- **Security**: Security measures integrated into architecture

#### Component Analysis
```mermaid

    A[Frontend] --> B[API Gateway]
    B --> C[Business Logic]
    C --> D[Data Layer]
    D --> E[Database]
    
    B --> F[Authentication]
    B --> G[Rate Limiting]
    C --> H[External Services]
```

### üî¥ Technical Standards Compliance

#### Technology Stack Alignment
- **Language/Framework Consistency**: Uses established project technologies
- **Coding Standards**: Follows project conventions and patterns
- **Library Choices**: Leverages existing dependencies where possible
- **Architecture Patterns**: Consistent with established patterns

#### Best Practices Validation
- **SOLID Principles**: Single responsibility, open/closed, etc.
- **Design Patterns**: Appropriate use of established patterns
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling approach
- **Logging Strategy**: Proper logging and monitoring integration

### üü¢ Integration and Leverage Analysis

#### Existing System Integration
- **Code Reuse**: Identifies reusable components and utilities
- **API Integration**: Defines integration with existing APIs
- **Database Integration**: Leverages existing data models where appropriate
- **Service Integration**: Uses existing services and infrastructure

#### Dependency Management
```typescript
// Example: Leveraging existing services
interface DesignValidation {
  validateIntegration(design: DesignDocument): IntegrationReport;
  identifyReuseOpportunities(design: DesignDocument): ReuseOpportunity[];
  checkDependencies(design: DesignDocument): DependencyReport;
}
```

### üü† Completeness Verification

#### Requirements Coverage
- **Functional Requirements**: All functional requirements addressed
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, security, scalability covered
- **Edge Cases**: Error scenarios and edge cases considered
- **User Experience**: UI/UX considerations included

#### Implementation Readiness
- **Technical Specifications**: Sufficient detail for implementation
- **Data Models**: Complete entity definitions and relationships
- **API Contracts**: Full endpoint specifications
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive test planning

## Validation Process

### üî∑ Automated Validation Steps

1. **Structure Check**
   ```bash
   # Validate document structure
   /validate-design-structure [design-file]
   ```

2. **Requirements Alignment**
   ```bash
   # Check requirements coverage
   /validate-requirements-coverage [design-file] [requirements-file]
   ```

3. **Technical Compliance**
   ```bash
   # Validate technical standards
   /validate-tech-compliance [design-file]
   ```

### üåü Advanced Validation Features

#### Automated Design Review
```typescript
interface DesignValidationResult {
  overallRating: 'PASS' | 'NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT' | 'MAJOR_ISSUES';
  templateCompliance: ValidationScore;
  architectureQuality: ValidationScore;
  technicalCompliance: ValidationScore;
  integrationAnalysis: ValidationScore;
  completeness: ValidationScore;
  improvementSuggestions: string[];
  criticalIssues: string[];
}
```

#### Integration with Development Workflow
- **Pre-implementation Validation**: Run before development starts
- **Change Impact Analysis**: Validate design changes
- **Documentation Sync**: Ensure docs match implementation
- **Quality Gate**: Block implementation on critical issues

## Output Format

### Validation Report Structure
```markdown
## Design Validation Report

### Overall Rating: [PASS/NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT/MAJOR_ISSUES]

### Template Compliance
- ‚úÖ All required sections present
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing Mermaid diagrams in Architecture section
- ‚úÖ Consistent formatting

### Architecture Quality
- ‚úÖ Well-defined component relationships
- ‚úÖ Scalable design approach
- ‚ùå Security considerations insufficient

### Technical Compliance
- ‚úÖ Follows established patterns
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Consider using existing UserService instead of creating new one

### Integration Analysis
- ‚úÖ Leverages existing authentication system
- ‚úÖ Integrates with existing database schema
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Opportunity to reuse existing validation utilities

### Completeness
- ‚úÖ All functional requirements addressed
- ‚ùå Error handling strategy incomplete
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Testing strategy needs more detail

### Critical Issues
1. Security measures need enhancement
2. Error handling strategy must be completed

### Improvement Suggestions
1. Add comprehensive error handling section
2. Include security threat model
3. Leverage existing UserValidation utility
4. Add performance benchmarks to testing strategy
```

## Integration with Claude Command Suite

### Command Integration
- `/dev:validate-design` - Validate design document
- `/docs:design-review` - Generate design review report  
- `/project:validate-spec` - Full specification validation

### Agent Orchestration
- Works with `architecture-auditor` for comprehensive review
- Integrates with `code-auditor` for implementation validation
- Coordinates with `test-engineer` for testing strategy validation

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use
- **Before implementation begins**: Validate design completeness
- **During design reviews**: Systematic quality assessment
- **On design changes**: Impact analysis and validation
- **Pre-deployment**: Final design-implementation alignment check

### Quality Thresholds
- **PASS**: All sections complete, no critical issues
- **NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT**: Minor issues, specific improvements needed
- **MAJOR_ISSUES**: Critical gaps, significant rework required
